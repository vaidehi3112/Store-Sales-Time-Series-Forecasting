# Store Sales: Time Series Forecasting

**Authors:** Vaidehi Pareshkumar Parikh, Uma Nishikant Patil, Yashvi Bhandari  

## Summary

This project aims to predict the sales for each product family and store combinations of a large grocery retailer in Ecuador named Corporaci√≥n Favorita by implementing time series forecasting. The project uses various machine learning and forecasting models to achieve this.

## Dataset

The dataset includes five CSV files:

1. **Train data:** Time series of the stores and a combination of product families.
2. **Stores:** Information about stores such as city, state, type, cluster.
3. **Transaction:** Information about transactions made on a particular date and store.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **MSLE (Mean squared logarithmic error)**
- **MAPE (mean absolute percentage error)**

## Models Used

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regressor**
3. **Bagging Regressor**
4. **Extra Tree Classifier**

## Future Work

The project is expandable for future explorations. We would like to explore various anomaly detection methods and hyperparameter tuning for better predictions. We would also like to explore LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), Neural Networks, and Advanced Time series Analysis methods like Facebook Prophet.
